patient care. This feature involves:
1- Customized Treatment Plans: The system analyzes the patient's medical history and current 
health data to generate treatment recommendations that are personalized to the patient's 
condition.
2- Minimizing Side Effects: By considering the patient's specific medical profile, the system can 
recommend drugs and therapies that are less likely to produce adverse side effects, 
thereby improving patient safety and comfort.

• Integration with Imaging Systems:
 - EHR systems offer comprehensive tools to facilitate patient care and appointment scheduling:
1 - Report Generation: Using the patient data stored in the EHR database, the system can 
generate detailed patient reports, including X-ray analyses, and treatment schedules. 
These reports can be easily shared with the patient or other medical professionals.
2 -Direct Imaging Integration: The EHR system integrates with imaging systems, allowing 
doctors to view X-ray and other imaging reports directly from the EHR interface. This 
streamlines diagnostic processes and supports informed decision-making.

• AI-Powered Chatbot:
- Integrate an AI-powered chatbot into your EHR system to enhance doctors’ engagement and 
provide immediate assistance. The chatbot can handle tasks such as appointment scheduling, 
medication reminders, and answering frequently asked questions. Doctor and staff can interact 
with the chatbot to quickly access information and support.

• Data Analysis:
-Generate graphical representations, such as charts and graphs, to depict key data points related 
to patients and clinic.

• Integration with patients:
 EHR systems streamline patient registration and record-keeping by:
1- Unique Identifiers
2- Scanning of Paper Records
• Scanning & Upload patient's history
• Timely Data Updates
